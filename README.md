# Dynamic_Array_inC
Where all my nightmares come true.

#Two things I hate
- Memory management (MALLOC, REALLOC, CALLOC, BULLSHITLOC);
- and how I can't understand it.

# ATTENTION : material provided by my teacher as a tool of learning and understanding structs and memory management. So the code is mixed with what I did and with I already got with him (: just to be honest.
